            <p> 同志们：</p>
            <p> Comrades, </p>
            <p> 现在，我代表第十九届中央委员会向大会作报告。 </p>
            <p> On behalf of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), I will now deliver a
                report to the 20th National Congress. </p>
            <p>
                中国共产党第二十次全国代表大会，是在全党全国各族人民迈上全面建设社会主义现代化国家新征程、向第二个百年奋斗目标进军的关键时刻召开的一次十分重要的大会。 </p>
            <p> The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China is a meeting of great importance. It
                takes place at a critical time as the entire Party and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups
                embark on a new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects and advance
                toward the Second Centenary Goal. </p>
            <p>
                大会的主题是：高举中国特色社会主义伟大旗帜，全面贯彻新时代中国特色社会主义思想，弘扬伟大建党精神，自信自强、守正创新，踔厉奋发、勇毅前行，为全面建设社会主义现代化国家、全面推进中华民族伟大复兴而团结奋斗。 </p>
            <p> The theme of this Congress is holding high the great banner of socialism with Chinese
                characteristics, fully implementing the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New
                Era, carrying forward the great founding spirit of the Party, staying confident and building
                strength, upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground, forging ahead with enterprise
                and fortitude, and striving in unity to build a modern socialist country in all respects and advance
                the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts. </p>
            <p>
                中国共产党已走过百年奋斗历程。我们党立志于中华民族千秋伟业，致力于人类和平与发展崇高事业，责任无比重大，使命无上光荣。全党同志务必不忘初心、牢记使命，务必谦虚谨慎、艰苦奋斗，务必敢于斗争、善于斗争，坚定历史自信，增强历史主动，谱写新时代中国特色社会主义更加绚丽的华章。 </p>
            <p> Since its founding a century ago, the Communist Party of China has taken a remarkable journey. Our
                Party has dedicated itself to achieving lasting greatness for the Chinese nation and committed
                itself to the noble cause of peace and development for humanity. Our responsibility is unmatched in
                importance, and our mission is glorious beyond compare. It is imperative that all of us in the Party
                never forget our original aspiration and founding mission, that we always stay modest, prudent, and
                hard-working, and that we have the courage and ability to carry on our fight. We must remain
                confident in our history, exhibit greater historical initiative, and write an even more magnificent
                chapter for socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. </p>
            <p> 一 过去五年的工作和新时代十年的伟大变革 </p>
            <p> I. The Work of the Past Five Years and the Great Changes in the First Decade of the New Era </p>
            <p>
                十九大以来的五年，是极不寻常、极不平凡的五年。党中央统筹中华民族伟大复兴战略全局和世界百年未有之大变局，召开七次全会，分别就宪法修改，深化党和国家机构改革，坚持和完善中国特色社会主义制度、推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化，制定“十四五”规划和二〇三五年远景目标，全面总结党的百年奋斗重大成就和历史经验等重大问题作出决定和决议，就党和国家事业发展作出重大战略部署，团结带领全党全军全国各族人民有效应对严峻复杂的国际形势和接踵而至的巨大风险挑战，以奋发有为的精神把新时代中国特色社会主义不断推向前进。 </p>
            <p> The five years since the 19th National Congress have been truly momentous and extraordinary. The
                Party Central Committee has pursued a strategy of national rejuvenation amid global changes of a
                magnitude not seen in a century. It has convened seven plenary sessions, at which it adopted
                decisions and resolutions on major issues such as revising China's Constitution, deepening reform of
                Party and state institutions, upholding and improving the system of socialism with Chinese
                characteristics and modernizing China's system and capacity for governance, formulating the 14th
                Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives through the Year
                2035, and conducting a thorough review of the Party's major achievements and historical experience
                over the past century. At these sessions, major strategic plans were also made for advancing the
                cause of the Party and the country. The Central Committee has brought together the entire Party, the
                military, and the Chinese people and led them in effectively responding to grave, intricate
                international developments and a series of immense risks and challenges. With great effort and
                determination, we have steadily advanced socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. </p>
            <p>
                五年来，我们坚持加强党的全面领导和党中央集中统一领导，全力推进全面建成小康社会进程，完整、准确、全面贯彻新发展理念，着力推动高质量发展，主动构建新发展格局，蹄疾步稳推进改革，扎实推进全过程人民民主，全面推进依法治国，积极发展社会主义先进文化，突出保障和改善民生，集中力量实施脱贫攻坚战，大力推进生态文明建设，坚决维护国家安全，防范化解重大风险，保持社会大局稳定，大力度推进国防和军队现代化建设，全方位开展中国特色大国外交，全面推进党的建设新的伟大工程。我们隆重庆祝中国共产党成立一百周年、中华人民共和国成立七十周年，制定第三个历史决议，在全党开展党史学习教育，建成中国共产党历史展览馆，号召全党学习和践行伟大建党精神，在新的征程上更加坚定、更加自觉地牢记初心使命、开创美好未来。 </p>
            <p> Over the past five years, we have continued to strengthen the overall leadership of the Party and
                the centralized, unified leadership of the Central Committee. We have devoted great energy to
                finishing building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. We have fully and faithfully
                applied the new development philosophy on all fronts, focused on promoting high-quality development,
                and worked to create a new pattern of development. We have pursued reform at a swift and steady
                pace, made solid progress in developing whole-process people's democracy, and advanced law-based
                governance across all fields of endeavor. We have actively developed advanced socialist culture. We
                have ensured and improved public wellbeing as a matter of priority and pooled resources to wage a
                critical battle against poverty. We have made a big push to enhance ecological conservation. We have
                worked with firm resolve to safeguard national security, fended off and defused major risks, and
                ensured social stability. We have devoted great energy to modernizing our national defense and the
                armed forces. We have conducted major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics on all fronts.
                And we have made sweeping efforts to advance the great new project of Party building. </p>
            <p> We celebrated the centenary of the Communist Party of China and the 70th anniversary of the founding
                of the People's Republic of China. We adopted the third resolution concerning the Party's history,
                organized Party-wide activities to study Party history, and inaugurated the Museum of the Communist
                Party of China. We called upon all Party members to study and apply the great founding spirit of the
                Party, and we encouraged them to create a brighter future by staying true to the Party's founding
                mission with greater resolve and purpose on the new journey ahead. </p>
            <p>
                特别是面对突如其来的新冠肺炎疫情，我们坚持人民至上、生命至上，坚持外防输入、内防反弹，坚持动态清零不动摇，开展抗击疫情人民战争、总体战、阻击战，最大限度保护了人民生命安全和身体健康，统筹疫情防控和经济社会发展取得重大积极成果。面对香港局势动荡变化，我们依照宪法和基本法有效实施对特别行政区的全面管治权，制定实施香港特别行政区维护国家安全法，落实“爱国者治港”原则，香港局势实现由乱到治的重大转折，深入推进粤港澳大湾区建设，支持香港、澳门发展经济、改善民生、保持稳定。面对“台独”势力分裂活动和外部势力干涉台湾事务的严重挑衅，我们坚决开展反分裂、反干涉重大斗争，展示了我们维护国家主权和领土完整、反对“台独”的坚强决心和强大能力，进一步掌握了实现祖国完全统一的战略主动，进一步巩固了国际社会坚持一个中国的格局。面对国际局势急剧变化，特别是面对外部讹诈、遏制、封锁、极限施压，我们坚持国家利益为重、国内政治优先，保持战略定力，发扬斗争精神，展示不畏强权的坚定意志，在斗争中维护国家尊严和核心利益，牢牢掌握了我国发展和安全主动权。五年来，我们党团结带领人民，攻克了许多长期没有解决的难题，办成了许多事关长远的大事要事，推动党和国家事业取得举世瞩目的重大成就。 </p>
            <p> In responding to the sudden outbreak of Covid-19, we put the people and their lives above all else,
                worked to prevent both imported cases and domestic resurgences, and tenaciously pursued a dynamic
                zero-Covid policy. In launching an all-out people's war to stop the spread of the virus, we have
                protected the people's health and safety to the greatest extent possible and made tremendously
                encouraging achievements in both epidemic response and economic and social development. </p>
            <p> In the face of turbulent developments in Hong Kong, the central government exercised its overall
                jurisdiction over the special administrative region as prescribed by China's Constitution and the
                Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Law on Safeguarding National Security
                in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was formulated and put into effect, ensuring that
                Hong Kong is administered by patriots. Thanks to these moves, order has been restored in Hong Kong,
                marking a major turn for the better in the region. Further headway has been made in developing the
                Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and supporting Hong Kong and Macao in growing their
                economies, improving living standards, and maintaining stability. </p>
            <p> In response to separatist activities aimed at “Taiwan independence” and gross provocations of
                external interference in Taiwan affairs, we have resolutely fought against separatism and countered
                interference, demonstrating our resolve and ability to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial
                integrity and to oppose “Taiwan independence.” We have strengthened our strategic initiative for
                China's complete reunification and consolidated commitment to the one-China principle within the
                international community. </p>
            <p> Confronted with drastic changes in the international landscape, especially external attempts to
                blackmail, contain, blockade, and exert maximum pressure on China, we have put our national
                interests first, focused on internal political concerns, and maintained firm strategic resolve. We
                have shown a fighting spirit and a firm determination to never yield to coercive power. Throughout
                these endeavors, we have safeguarded China's dignity and core interests and kept ourselves
                well-positioned for pursuing development and ensuring security. </p>
            <p> Over the past five years, our Party has rallied the people and led them in solving a great number of
                problems that had long gone unsolved, securing many accomplishments that hold major future
                significance, and achieving impressive advances in the cause of the Party and the country. </p>
            <p>
                同志们！十八大召开至今已经十年了。十年来，我们经历了对党和人民事业具有重大现实意义和深远历史意义的三件大事：一是迎来中国共产党成立一百周年，二是中国特色社会主义进入新时代，三是完成脱贫攻坚、全面建成小康社会的历史任务，实现第一个百年奋斗目标。这是中国共产党和中国人民团结奋斗赢得的历史性胜利，是彪炳中华民族发展史册的历史性胜利，也是对世界具有深远影响的历史性胜利。 </p>
            <p> Comrades, </p>
            <p> Ten years have passed since the Party's 18th National Congress. The past decade marked three major
                events of great immediate importance and profound historical significance for the cause of the Party
                and the people: We embraced the centenary of the Communist Party of China; we ushered in a new era
                of socialism with Chinese characteristics; and we eradicated absolute poverty and finished building
                a moderately prosperous society in all respects, thus completing the First Centenary Goal. These
                were historic feats—feats accomplished by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people
                striving in unity, feats that will be forever recorded in the Chinese nation's history, and feats
                that will profoundly influence the world. </p>
            <p>
                十年前，我们面对的形势是，改革开放和社会主义现代化建设取得巨大成就，党的建设新的伟大工程取得显著成效，为我们继续前进奠定了坚实基础、创造了良好条件、提供了重要保障，同时一系列长期积累及新出现的突出矛盾和问题亟待解决。党内存在不少对坚持党的领导认识模糊、行动乏力问题，存在不少落实党的领导弱化、虚化、淡化问题，有些党员、干部政治信仰发生动摇，一些地方和部门形式主义、官僚主义、享乐主义和奢靡之风屡禁不止，特权思想和特权现象较为严重，一些贪腐问题触目惊心；经济结构性体制性矛盾突出，发展不平衡、不协调、不可持续，传统发展模式难以为继，一些深层次体制机制问题和利益固化藩篱日益显现；一些人对中国特色社会主义政治制度自信不足，有法不依、执法不严等问题严重存在；拜金主义、享乐主义、极端个人主义和历史虚无主义等错误思潮不时出现，网络舆论乱象丛生，严重影响人们思想和社会舆论环境；民生保障存在不少薄弱环节；资源环境约束趋紧、环境污染等问题突出；维护国家安全制度不完善、应对各种重大风险能力不强，国防和军队现代化存在不少短板弱项；香港、澳门落实“一国两制”的体制机制不健全；国家安全受到严峻挑战，等等。当时，党内和社会上不少人对党和国家前途忧心忡忡。面对这些影响党长期执政、国家长治久安、人民幸福安康的突出矛盾和问题，党中央审时度势、果敢抉择，锐意进取、攻坚克难，团结带领全党全军全国各族人民撸起袖子加油干、风雨无阻向前行，义无反顾进行具有许多新的历史特点的伟大斗争。 </p>
            <p> A decade ago this was the situation we faced: </p>
            <p> Great achievements had been secured in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, and notable
                advances had been made in the great new project of Party building. All this had created solid
                foundations, favorable conditions, and key underpinnings for our continued progress. </p>
            <p> At the same time, however, a number of prominent issues and problems—some of which had been building
                for years and others which were just emerging—demanded urgent action. </p>
            <p> Inside the Party, there were many issues with respect to upholding the Party's leadership, including
                a lack of clear understanding and effective action as well as a slide toward weak, hollow, and
                watered-down Party leadership in practice. Some Party members and officials were wavering in their
                political conviction. Despite repeated warnings, pointless formalities, bureaucratism, hedonism, and
                extravagance persisted in some localities and departments. Privilege-seeking mindsets and practices
                posed a serious problem, and some deeply shocking cases of corruption had been uncovered. </p>
            <p> China's economy was beset by acute structural and institutional problems. Development was
                imbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable, and the traditional development model could no longer
                keep us moving forward. Some deep-seated problems in institutions and barriers built by vested
                interests were becoming more and more apparent. </p>
            <p> Some people lacked confidence in the socialist political system with Chinese characteristics, and,
                all too often, we saw laws being ignored or not being strictly enforced. </p>
            <p> Misguided patterns of thinking such as money worship, hedonism, egocentricity, and historical
                nihilism were common, and online discourse was rife with disorder. All this had a grave impact on
                people's thinking and the public opinion environment. </p>
            <p> Our work to ensure the people's wellbeing was fraught with weak links. Tightening resource and
                environmental constraints and environmental pollution were pronounced. </p>
            <p> The systems for safeguarding national security were inadequate, and our capacity for responding to
                various major risks was insufficient. Many shortcomings were affecting the modernization of national
                defense and the military. </p>
            <p> The institutions and mechanisms for implementing the policy of One Country, Two Systems in Hong Kong
                and Macao were not well-developed, and China faced grave challenges to its national security. </p>
            <p> These were just some of the problems we faced. Back then, many people, both in and outside of our
                Party, were worried about the future of the Party and the country. </p>
            <p> In the face of these acute problems and challenges, which undermined the Party's long-term
                governance, the security and stability of the country, and the wellbeing of the people, the Party
                Central Committee fully assessed the situation, made resolute decisions, and took firm steps. Under
                its leadership, the entire Party, the military, and the Chinese people were brought together. We
                rolled up our sleeves and got down to work, forging ahead with resolve to carry out a great struggle
                with many new features of our times. </p>
            <p>
                十年来，我们坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观，全面贯彻新时代中国特色社会主义思想，全面贯彻党的基本路线、基本方略，采取一系列战略性举措，推进一系列变革性实践，实现一系列突破性进展，取得一系列标志性成果，经受住了来自政治、经济、意识形态、自然界等方面的风险挑战考验，党和国家事业取得历史性成就、发生历史性变革，推动我国迈上全面建设社会主义现代化国家新征程。 </p>
            <p> Over the past decade, we have stayed committed to Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng
                Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, and we
                have fully implemented the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as well
                as the Party's basic line and basic policy. We have adopted a number of strategic measures,
                developed a range of transformative practices, and made a series of breakthroughs and landmark
                advances. We have withstood risks, challenges, and trials in the political, economic, ideological,
                and natural domains, secured historic achievements and seen historic changes in the cause of the
                Party and the country, and taken China on a new journey toward building a modern socialist country
                in all respects. </p>
            <p>
                ——我们创立了新时代中国特色社会主义思想，明确坚持和发展中国特色社会主义的基本方略，提出一系列治国理政新理念新思想新战略，实现了马克思主义中国化时代化新的飞跃，坚持不懈用这一创新理论武装头脑、指导实践、推动工作，为新时代党和国家事业发展提供了根本遵循。 </p>
            <p> —We have established the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. In doing
                so, we have laid out the basic policy for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese
                characteristics, put forward a series of new ideas, new thinking, and new strategies on national
                governance, and achieved a new breakthrough in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs
                of our times. We have endeavored to use this new theory to arm ourselves intellectually, guide our
                practice, and advance our work. This theory provides us with fundamental guidance for advancing the
                cause of our Party and our country in the new era. </p>
            <p>
                ——我们全面加强党的领导，明确中国特色社会主义最本质的特征是中国共产党领导，中国特色社会主义制度的最大优势是中国共产党领导，中国共产党是最高政治领导力量，坚持党中央集中统一领导是最高政治原则，系统完善党的领导制度体系，全党增强“四个意识”，自觉在思想上政治上行动上同党中央保持高度一致，不断提高政治判断力、政治领悟力、政治执行力，确保党中央权威和集中统一领导，确保党发挥总揽全局、协调各方的领导核心作用，我们这个拥有九千六百多万名党员的马克思主义政党更加团结统一。 </p>
            <p> —We have strengthened Party leadership in all respects. We have made clear that the leadership of
                the Communist Party of China is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and
                the greatest strength of the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, that the Party is the
                highest force of political leadership, and that upholding the centralized, unified leadership of the
                Party Central Committee is the highest political principle. We have made systematic improvements to
                the Party's leadership systems. All Party members have become more conscious of the need to maintain
                political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment
                with the central Party leadership. They have become more purposeful in closely following the Party
                Central Committee in thinking, political stance, and action, and they have continued to improve
                their capacity for political judgment, thinking, and implementation. All this has ensured the Party
                Central Committee's authority and its centralized, unified leadership and guaranteed that the Party
                fulfills its core role of exercising overall leadership and coordinating the efforts of all sides.
                Now, our Marxist party of over 96 million members enjoys greater unity and solidarity than
                ever. </p>
            <p>
                ——我们对新时代党和国家事业发展作出科学完整的战略部署，提出实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，以中国式现代化推进中华民族伟大复兴，统揽伟大斗争、伟大工程、伟大事业、伟大梦想，明确“五位一体”总体布局和“四个全面”战略布局，确定稳中求进工作总基调，统筹发展和安全，明确我国社会主要矛盾是人民日益增长的美好生活需要和不平衡不充分的发展之间的矛盾，并紧紧围绕这个社会主要矛盾推进各项工作，不断丰富和发展人类文明新形态。 </p>
            <p> —We have developed well-conceived and complete strategic plans for advancing the cause of the Party
                and the country in the new era. We have put forward the Chinese Dream of the great rejuvenation of
                the Chinese nation and proposed promoting national rejuvenation through a Chinese path to
                modernization. We have made well-coordinated efforts to advance our great struggle, our great
                project, our great cause, and our great dream. We have adopted the Five-Sphere Integrated Plan and
                the Four-Pronged Comprehensive Strategy as well as the general principle of pursuing progress while
                ensuring stability, and we have worked to both pursue development and safeguard security. We have
                identified the principal contradiction facing Chinese society as that between unbalanced and
                inadequate development and the people's ever-growing needs for a better life, and we have made it
                clear that closing this gap should be the focus of all our initiatives. With these efforts, we have
                made constant progress in enriching and developing a new form of human advancement. </p>
            <p>
                ——我们经过接续奋斗，实现了小康这个中华民族的千年梦想，我国发展站在了更高历史起点上。我们坚持精准扶贫、尽锐出战，打赢了人类历史上规模最大的脱贫攻坚战，全国八百三十二个贫困县全部摘帽，近一亿农村贫困人口实现脱贫，九百六十多万贫困人口实现易地搬迁，历史性地解决了绝对贫困问题，为全球减贫事业作出了重大贡献。 </p>
            <p> —We have achieved moderate prosperity, the millennia-old dream of the Chinese nation, through
                persistent hard work. With this, we have elevated China to a higher historical starting point in
                development. By galvanizing the entire nation to carry out targeted poverty alleviation, we have won
                the largest battle against poverty in human history. A total of 832 impoverished counties and close
                to 100 million poor rural residents have been lifted out of poverty, and, among them, more than 9.6
                million poverty-stricken people have been relocated from inhospitable areas. We have, once and for
                all, resolved the problem of absolute poverty in China, making significant contributions to the
                cause of global poverty reduction. </p>

            <p> —We have put forward and applied a new development philosophy, worked hard to promote high-quality
                development, and pushed to foster a new pattern of development. We have carried out supply-side
                structural reform, formulated a series of major regional strategies important to China's overall
                development, and brought about a historic rise in China's economic strength. </p>

                18.5 percent of the world economy, up 7.2 percentage points. China has remained the world's second
                largest economy, and its per capita GDP has risen from 39,800 yuan to 81,000 yuan. It ranks first in
                the world in terms of grain output, and it has ensured food and energy security for its more than

                account for 64.7 percent of the population. China's manufacturing sector is the largest in the
                world, as are its foreign exchange reserves. China has built the world's largest networks of
                high-speed railways and expressways and made major achievements in building airports, ports, and
                water conservancy, energy, information, and other infrastructure. </p>
            <p> We have accelerated efforts to build our self-reliance and strength in science and technology, with
                nationwide R&D spending rising from 1 trillion yuan to 2.8 trillion yuan, the second highest in the
                world. Our country is now home to the largest cohort of R&D personnel in the world. </p>
            <p> We have grown stronger in basic research and original innovation, made breakthroughs in some core
                technologies in key fields, and boosted emerging strategic industries. We have witnessed major
                successes on multiple fronts, including manned spaceflight, lunar and Martian exploration, deep sea
                and deep earth probes, supercomputers, satellite navigation, quantum information, nuclear power
                technology, new energy technology, airliner manufacturing, and biomedicine. China has joined the
                ranks of the world's innovators. </p>
            <p>

            <p> —We have comprehensively deepened reform with tremendous political courage. We have carried out
                critical tasks and enhanced top-level design for reform. We have dared to brave uncharted waters,
                take on tough problems, navigate potential dangers, and face new issues and challenges. We have
                broken the shackles of stale thinking, torn down barriers erected by vested interests, and removed
                institutional obstacles in all areas. This has enabled us to put in place foundational institutional
                frameworks in all sectors, to achieve historic, systemic, and holistic transformations in many
                fields, and to complete a new round of reform in Party and state institutions. The system of
                socialism with Chinese characteristics has become more mature and well-defined, and China's system
                and capacity for governance have been further modernized. </p>

            <p> —We have pursued a more proactive strategy of opening up. We have worked to build a
                globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas and accelerated the development of pilot
                free trade zones and the Hainan Free Trade Port. As a collaborative endeavor, the Belt and Road
                Initiative has been welcomed by the international community both as a public good and a cooperation
                platform. China has become a major trading partner for more than 140 countries and regions, it leads
                the world in total volume of trade in goods, and it is a major destination for global investment and
                a leading country in outbound investment. Through these efforts, we have advanced a broader agenda
                of opening up across more areas and in greater depth. </p>

            <p> —We have kept to the path of socialist political advancement with Chinese characteristics. We have
                comprehensively developed whole-process people's democracy, made all-around progress in improving
                the institutions, standards, and procedures of our socialist democracy, and advanced socialist
                consultative democracy by way of extensive participation. We have reinforced the foundations that
                undergird the people's running of the country, injected fresh vitality into democracy at the
                community level, and consolidated and expanded the patriotic united front. We have made new
                accomplishments in promoting ethnic unity and progress, fully implemented the Party's basic policy
                on religious affairs, and provided better protections for human rights. We have intensified efforts
                to advance socialist rule of law in our country, and a comprehensive framework for law-based
                governance has taken shape. We have sped up work on developing the system of socialist rule of law
                with Chinese characteristics. We have made major progress in reforming the judicial system, thus
                providing more effective protection for social fairness and justice. These efforts have opened new

            <p> —We have established and upheld a foundational system for ensuring the guiding role of Marxism in
                the ideological domain. The Party's new theory for the new era has been embraced by the people, the
                core socialist values are resonating with the public, fine traditional Chinese culture is undergoing
                creative transformation and development, cultural programs are flourishing, and the online
                environment has seen continuous improvement. All this has brought overarching and fundamental
                changes in China's ideological landscape. </p>
            <p> We celebrated the 90th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the 40th
                anniversary of the launch of reform and opening up, the 70th anniversary of victory in the Chinese

                70th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' departure for Korea to resist US aggression and
                aid Korea. The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics were a great success. Our young people
                are filled with greater optimism and enterprise, and there is a notably stronger sense of cultural
                confidence and a higher level of morale throughout the Party and the nation. </p>

                and social assistance, thus bringing about an all-around improvement in people's lives. China's life
                expectancy has reached 78.2 years, its per capita disposable annual income has risen from 16,500
                yuan to 35,100 yuan, and more than 13 million urban jobs have been created each year on average over
                the past 10 years. We have built the largest education, social security, and healthcare systems in
                the world. These achievements have allowed us to make historic strides in making education
                universally available, bring 1.04 billion people under the coverage of basic old-age insurance, and
                ensure basic medical insurance for 95 percent of the population. Timely adjustments have been made
                to the childbirth policy. More than 42 million housing units in run-down urban areas and more than
                24 million dilapidated rural houses have been rebuilt, marking a significant improvement in housing
                conditions in both urban and rural areas. The number of internet users has reached 1.03 billion. We
                have ensured a more complete and lasting sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security for our
                people, and we have made further progress in achieving common prosperity for all. </p>

            <p> —We have acted on the idea that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets. We have
                persisted with a holistic and systematic approach to conserving and improving mountain, water,
                forest, farmland, grassland, and desert ecosystems, and we have ensured stronger ecological
                conservation and environmental protection across the board, in all regions, and at all times.
                China's ecological conservation systems have been improved, the critical battle against pollution
                has been advanced, and solid progress has been made in promoting green, circular, and low-carbon
                development. This has led to historic, transformative, and comprehensive changes in ecological and
                environmental protection and has brought us bluer skies, greener mountains, and cleaner waters. </p>

            <p> —We have applied a holistic approach to national security. We have steadily improved the leadership,
                legal, strategy, and policy systems for national security. We have not yielded any ground on matters
                of principle, and we have resolutely safeguarded China's sovereignty, security, and development
                interests. National security has thus been strengthened on all fronts. We have further improved the
                social governance system based on collaboration, participation, and shared benefits. We have
                effectively contained ethnic separatists, religious extremists, and violent terrorists and secured
                important progress in the campaigns to combat and root out organized crime. We have responded
                effectively to major natural disasters. The Peaceful China Initiative has entered a new stage. </p>
            <p>
                ——我们确立党在新时代的强军目标，贯彻新时代党的强军思想，贯彻新时代军事战略方针，坚持党对人民军队的绝对领导，召开古田全军政治工作会议，以整风精神推进政治整训，牢固树立战斗力这个唯一的根本的标准，坚决把全军工作重心归正到备战打仗上来，统筹加强各方向各领域军事斗争，大抓实战化军事训练，大刀阔斧深化国防和军队改革，重构人民军队领导指挥体制、现代军事力量体系、军事政策制度，加快国防和军队现代化建设，裁减现役员额三十万胜利完成，人民军队体制一新、结构一新、格局一新、面貌一新，现代化水平和实战能力显著提升，中国特色强军之路越走越宽广。 </p>
            <p> —We have set the Party's goal of building a strong military in the new era. We have implemented the
                Party's thinking on strengthening the military for the new era, followed the military strategy for
                the new era, and upheld absolute Party leadership over the people's armed forces. We held a meeting
                on military political work in Gutian in 2014 and improved political conduct through rectification
                initiatives. Having established combat effectiveness as the sole criterion, we have acted with
                resolve to focus the entire military's attention on combat readiness. We have coordinated efforts to
                strengthen military work in all directions and domains and devoted great energy to training under
                combat conditions. We have carried out bold reforms of national defense and the armed forces,
                restructuring the military leadership and command systems, the modern armed forces system, and the
                military policy system. We have moved faster to modernize our national defense and the armed forces
                and reduced the number of active service personnel by 300,000. With new systems, a new structure, a
                new configuration, and a new look, the people's armed forces have become a much more modern and
                capable fighting force, and the Chinese path to building a strong military is growing ever
                broader. </p>

            <p> —We have fully and faithfully implemented the policy of One Country, Two Systems. We have upheld the
                policy of One Country, Two Systems, under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong and the
                people of Macao administer Macao, both with a high degree of autonomy. We have helped Hong Kong
                enter a new stage in which it has restored order and is set to thrive, and we have seen both Hong
                Kong and Macao maintain good momentum for long-term stability and development. We have put forward
                an overall policy framework for resolving the Taiwan question in the new era and facilitated
                cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation. We have resolutely opposed separatist activities aimed at
                “Taiwan independence” and foreign interference. We have thus maintained the initiative and the
                ability to steer in cross-Strait relations. </p>

                promoted the development of a human community with a shared future and stood firm in protecting
                international fairness and justice. We have advocated and practiced true multilateralism. We have
                taken a clear-cut stance against hegemonism and power politics in all their forms, and we have never
                wavered in our opposition to unilateralism, protectionism, and bullying of any kind. We have
                improved China's overall diplomatic agenda and worked actively to build a global network of
                partnerships and foster a new type of international relations. We have demonstrated China's sense of
                duty as a responsible major country, actively participating in the reform and development of the
                global governance system and engaging in all-around international cooperation in the fight against
                Covid-19. All this has seen us win widespread international recognition. China's international
                influence, appeal, and power to shape have risen markedly. </p>

                ——我们深入推进全面从严治党，坚持打铁必须自身硬，从制定和落实中央八项规定开局破题，提出和落实新时代党的建设总要求，以党的政治建设统领党的建设各项工作，坚持思想建党和制度治党同向发力，严肃党内政治生活，持续开展党内集中教育，提出和坚持新时代党的组织路线，突出政治标准选贤任能，加强政治巡视，形成比较完善的党内法规体系，推动全党坚定理想信念、严密组织体系、严明纪律规矩。我们持之以恒正风肃纪，以钉钉子精神纠治“四风”，反对特权思想和特权现象，坚决整治群众身边的不正之风和腐败问题，刹住了一些长期没有刹住的歪风，纠治了一些多年未除的顽瘴痼疾。我们开展了史无前例的反腐败斗争，以“得罪千百人、不负十四亿”的使命担当祛疴治乱，不敢腐、不能腐、不想腐一体推进，“打虎”、“拍蝇”、“猎狐”多管齐下，反腐败斗争取得压倒性胜利并全面巩固，消除了党、国家、军队内部存在的严重隐患，确保党和人民赋予的权力始终用来为人民谋幸福。经过不懈努力，党找到了自我革命这一跳出治乱兴衰历史周期率的第二个答案，自我净化、自我完善、自我革新、自我提高能力显著增强，管党治党宽松软状况得到根本扭转，风清气正的党内政治生态不断形成和发展，确保党永远不变质、不变色、不变味。 </p>
            <p> —We have made significant advances in exercising full and rigorous Party self-governance. Guided by
                the belief that it takes a good blacksmith to forge good steel, we kicked off our efforts by
                formulating and implementing the central Party leadership's eight-point decision on improving
                conduct. We have put forward and implemented the general requirements for strengthening the Party in
                the new era. We have set strengthening ourselves politically as the overarching guide for all other
                initiatives of Party building, and we have made sure that our ideological work is aligned with our
                institution building efforts. Intraparty political activities have been conducted in earnest, and we
                have continued to carry out intensive education initiatives. We have formulated and implemented the
                Party's organizational line for the new era and placed an emphasis on political commitment in
                selecting and appointing officials. Political inspections have been strengthened, and a sound system
                of Party regulations has taken shape. These moves have enabled the entire Party to maintain firm
                ideals and convictions and have strengthened the Party's organizational system and tightened
                discipline and rules. </p>
            <p> We have worked ceaselessly to improve Party conduct and enforce Party discipline. We have hammered
                away at the task of rectifying pointless formalities, bureaucratism, hedonism, and extravagance;
                opposed privilege-seeking mindsets and practices; and taken strong action to address misconduct and
                corruption that occur at people's doorsteps. Thanks to these efforts, unhealthy tendencies that had
                long gone unchecked have been reversed, and deep-seated problems that had plagued us for years have
                been remedied. </p>
            <p> We have waged a battle against corruption on a scale unprecedented in our history. Driven by a
                strong sense of mission, we have resolved to “offend a few thousand rather than fail 1.4 billion”
                and to clear our Party of all its ills. We have taken coordinated steps to see that officials do not
                have the audacity, opportunity, or desire to be corrupt, and we have used a combination of measures
                to “take out tigers,” “swat flies,” and “hunt down foxes,” punishing corrupt officials of all types.
                We have achieved an overwhelming victory and fully consolidated the gains in our fight against
                corruption. All this has helped remove serious hidden dangers in the Party, the country, and the
                military and ensured that the power granted to us by the Party and the people is always exercised in
                the interests of the people. </p>
            <p> Through painstaking efforts, the Party has found a second answer to the question of how to escape
                the historical cycle of rise and fall. The answer is self-reform. We have significantly boosted the
                Party's ability to purify, improve, renew, and excel itself, addressed the problem of lax and weak
                self-governance in Party organizations at the root, and steadily fostered and developed a political
                atmosphere of integrity within the Party. By doing so, we have ensured that the Party will never
                change its nature, its conviction, or its character. </p>
            <p>
                在充分肯定党和国家事业取得举世瞩目成就的同时，必须清醒看到，我们的工作还存在一些不足，面临不少困难和问题。主要有：发展不平衡不充分问题仍然突出，推进高质量发展还有许多卡点瓶颈，科技创新能力还不强；确保粮食、能源、产业链供应链可靠安全和防范金融风险还须解决许多重大问题；重点领域改革还有不少硬骨头要啃；意识形态领域存在不少挑战；城乡区域发展和收入分配差距仍然较大；群众在就业、教育、医疗、托育、养老、住房等方面面临不少难题；生态环境保护任务依然艰巨；一些党员、干部缺乏担当精神，斗争本领不强，实干精神不足，形式主义、官僚主义现象仍较突出；铲除腐败滋生土壤任务依然艰巨，等等。对这些问题，我们已经采取一系列措施加以解决，今后必须加大工作力度。 </p>
            <p> As we fully affirm the remarkable achievements we have made in the cause of the Party and the
                country, we must not lose sight of the shortcomings in our work and the many difficulties and
                problems confronting us. They are mainly as follows: </p>
            <p> Imbalances and inadequacies in development remain a prominent problem. There are many bottlenecks
                hindering high-quality development, and China's capacity for scientific and technological innovation
                is not yet strong enough. Many major issues need to be resolved in order to guard against financial
                risks and ensure that food, energy, and industrial and supply chains are secure and reliable. </p>
            <p> There are still many tough issues to be addressed in the reform of key areas. Quite a few challenges
                exist in the ideological domain. There are still wide gaps in development and income distribution
                between urban and rural areas and between regions. Our people face many difficulties in areas such
                as employment, education, medical services, childcare, elderly care, and housing. Ecological
                conservation and environmental protection remain a formidable task. </p>
            <p> Some Party members and officials lack a strong sense of responsibility, the capacity to grapple with
                tough challenges, and the readiness to get down to work. Pointless formalities and bureaucratism
                remain rather pronounced. Eradicating breeding grounds for corruption is still an arduous task. </p>
            <p> We have already put in place a series of measures to deal with these problems, and we must redouble
                our efforts to see them fully resolved. </p>
            <p>
                同志们！新时代的伟大成就是党和人民一道拼出来、干出来、奋斗出来的！在这里，我代表中共中央，向全体中国共产党员，向全国各族人民，向各民主党派、各人民团体和各界爱国人士，向香港特别行政区同胞、澳门特别行政区同胞和台湾同胞以及广大侨胞，向关心和支持中国现代化建设的各国朋友，表示衷心的感谢！ </p>
            <p> Comrades, </p>
            <p> The great achievements of the new era have come from the collective dedication and hard work of our
                Party and our people. Here, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I
                express our heartfelt gratitude to all of our Party members, to the people of all ethnic groups, to
                all other political parties, people's organizations, and patriotic figures from all sectors of
                society, to our fellow compatriots in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, in
                Taiwan, and overseas, and to all our friends around the world who have shown understanding and
                support for China's modernization drive. </p>
            <p>
                新时代十年的伟大变革，在党史、新中国史、改革开放史、社会主义发展史、中华民族发展史上具有里程碑意义。走过百年奋斗历程的中国共产党在革命性锻造中更加坚强有力，党的政治领导力、思想引领力、群众组织力、社会号召力显著增强，党同人民群众始终保持血肉联系，中国共产党在世界形势深刻变化的历史进程中始终走在时代前列，在应对国内外各种风险和考验的历史进程中始终成为全国人民的主心骨，在坚持和发展中国特色社会主义的历史进程中始终成为坚强领导核心。中国人民的前进动力更加强大、奋斗精神更加昂扬、必胜信念更加坚定，焕发出更为强烈的历史自觉和主动精神，中国共产党和中国人民正信心百倍推进中华民族从站起来、富起来到强起来的伟大飞跃。改革开放和社会主义现代化建设深入推进，书写了经济快速发展和社会长期稳定两大奇迹新篇章，我国发展具备了更为坚实的物质基础、更为完善的制度保证，实现中华民族伟大复兴进入了不可逆转的历史进程。科学社会主义在二十一世纪的中国焕发出新的蓬勃生机，中国式现代化为人类实现现代化提供了新的选择，中国共产党和中国人民为解决人类面临的共同问题提供更多更好的中国智慧、中国方案、中国力量，为人类和平与发展崇高事业作出新的更大的贡献！ </p>
            <p> The great transformation over the past 10 years of the new era marks a milestone in the history of
                the Party, of the People's Republic of China, of reform and opening up, of the development of
                socialism, and of the development of the Chinese nation. Over the course of a century of endeavor,
                the Communist Party of China has tempered itself through revolution and grown stronger. It has grown
                better at providing political leadership, giving theoretical guidance, organizing the people, and
                inspiring society, all while maintaining a close bond with the people. Throughout the Party's
                history, as the world has undergone profound changes, it has always remained at the forefront of the
                times. As we have responded to risks and tests at home and abroad, the Party has always remained the
                backbone of the nation. And as we have upheld and developed socialism with Chinese characteristics,
                the Party has always remained a strong leadership core. </p>
            <p> The Chinese people are more inspired than ever to forge ahead, more resolved than ever to work hard,
                and more confident than ever of securing success. They are filled with a stronger sense of history
                and initiative. With full confidence, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are
                driving the great transformation of the Chinese nation from standing up and growing prosperous to
                becoming strong. We have advanced reform, opening up, and socialist modernization and have written a
                new chapter on the miracles of fast economic growth and long-term social stability. China now has
                more solid material foundations and stronger institutional underpinnings for pursuing development.
                The rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is now on an irreversible historical course. </p>
            <p> Scientific socialism is brimming with renewed vitality in 21st-century China. Chinese modernization
                offers humanity a new choice for achieving modernization. The Communist Party of China and the
                Chinese people have provided humanity with more Chinese insight, better Chinese input, and greater
                Chinese strength to help solve its common challenges and have made new and greater contributions to
                the noble cause of human peace and development. </p>
